				<p class="serif">I am a sophmore student attending James Campbell High School.I am in the Public and Human Services academy. I enrolled into PHS because I want to be a band director. I love music, music is basically my life. I basically go to school just because I can practice my instruments after school. After the last school bell rings, Im a very happy and chipper person. In class however, it is the exact opposit. Cool...
			
					Update....today is the 8th of January 2020 and I am imputting new information into this website. We have two new band directors at JCHS. Mathew Yamada and Theresa Miller. I do not know how they operate yet but hopefully it will be a good change...</p>
